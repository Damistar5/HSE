This notebook is designed for beginners who want to explore the basics of Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) data analytics. It introduces key concepts such as data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and data visualization in a beginner-friendly format.

Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights into the causes of industrial accidents and highlight practical measures for preventionâ€”such as enforcing safety protocols, offering proper training, and proactively identifying workplace hazards.

The notebook serves as a starting point for those new to HSE analytics, providing foundational knowledge while demonstrating how to work with data in a Notebook environment. For those who wish to dive deeper, a wide range of additional resources are available to support continued learning.

My goal is to both analyze the dataset to better understand accident trends and to guide beginners through the process of using Notebooks effectively for data analysis.
